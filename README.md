# Light Field VR Testbed #

There is a need for affordable and easily deployable rendering and display solutions to take full advantage of light field imaging.
In particular, the research community needs ways to better assess the impact of various light field imaging technologies based on different criteria. 

We propose a solution to render light field images on head mounted virtual reality displays using off-shelf components. 
The proposed framework is based on WebGL and supports rendering of narrow baseline light field images with interactions that result in changes of perspective. 
The system can be used in subjective quality assessments of light field via crowdsourcing. It also allows tracking and recoding of viewing interactions.
